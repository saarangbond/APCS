Part A:
Have a total variable
Go through the list of CookieOrder
    Get the number of each boxes and add it to total
return total


Part B:
Create a counter variable the represent the total number of boxes removed.
Go through the orders arraylist using a for loop
    call getVariety() orders at position i (e.g. get(i))
    if the result of the above is equals to the String cookieVar
        Get the number of boxes by calling getNumBoxes() and add it to the counter variable
        Remove it by calling remove(int) passing in the position (i)
        subtract i by one (e.g i--) since we removed a item from an ArrayList.
Return the counter variable
